# Kali Linux updated image

This image is sourced from the kasmweb kali image,
but should be able to be used conventionally.

The image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/voidarc/kali/general), 
and can be pulled with `docker pull voidarc/kali`

To build the image, use the command `docker build .` 
when in the same directory.
